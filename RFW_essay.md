I would love to explain a complex topic from my area of expertise.  The problem 
is that I do not have an area of expertise.  I am essentially a jack of all trades
and master of none.

I have spent my life pursuing a wide variety of interests.  I attended college
immediately after high school to pursue a journalism degree.  Midway through my
second semester I realized that I was not interested in becoming a journalist.
I dropped out of college and joined the Marine Corps.  In the Marine Corps, I
learned Morse Code and became an expert markswoman.  None of these skills were
in particular demand in the civilian world.

I worked in a variety of boring minimum wage jobs.  I finally came to the 
conclusion that no one would give me an interesting job, unless I had a piece
of paper from an accredited institution of higher learning.  I obtained the
requisite piece of paper and embarked upon a career in software development.
Along the way, I discovered that I really loved data and creating new ways to
manipulate it.  Eventually, this too came to an end.

Today, I find myself in the position of having many different skills that do
not appear to be in particular demand.  As I reinvent myself, I find that I
am still interested in creating things.  I am a creative person.  I would 
like to create things that inspire other people in meaningful ways.  I would
like for the world to be a little bit better because of something I have 
done.

I guess I have explained the most complex topic from my area of expertise.
Me. I know myself.
